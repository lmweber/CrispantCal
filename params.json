{"name":"CrispantCal","tagline":"R/Shiny web app to calculate injection mix volumes for CRISPR-Cas9 experiments","body":"### CRISPR-Cas9\r\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary new experimental technique for genome editing. For a scientific overview, see [this review](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1258096.full) (also available as a [PDF](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1258096.full.pdf)). For a less technical introduction, you can find a large number of articles and videos on the internet, for example [this article by Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/crispr-dna-editing-2/) or [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=crispr+cas9).\r\n\r\n### CrispantCal web calculator\r\nThis web tool calculates optimal injection mix volumes for CRISPR-Cas9 experiments in the lab. It is designed to be easily accessible from a laptop or phone, so that calculations can be made in the lab.\r\n\r\nCrispantCal was developed using the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) web application framework for the R programming language, and is hosted online using the ShinyApps.io[https://www.shinyapps.io/] service by RStudio.\r\n\r\n### How to access\r\nYou can access the CrispantCal calculator in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In a web browser (desktop or mobile) at the following address: https://lmweber.shinyapps.io/CrispantCal\r\n\r\n* Locally from R/RStudio, by installing and running from GitHub with the R command `runGitHub(\"lmweber/CrispantCal\")`. This requires the `shiny` package to be installed and loaded first, which can be done with the commands `install.packages(\"shiny\")` and `library(shiny)`.\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with R, we recommend [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) as a user-friendly editor and development environment. You will also need to download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). Introductory tutorials are available from the RStudio website.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed R and RStudio, open RStudio and paste the commands above into the Console window, which is on the left or in the bottom left corner of the screen in the default layout. The CrispantCal app should then launch in a new window or in the Viewer pane on the right.\r\n\r\n### More information\r\nInstructions on how to use the CrispantCal calculator and details about the calculations are shown in the Information section on the main page of the app.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\nDeveloped by Lukas M.
